# About StudyATHome Internationally

The faculty of Communication Technologies & Electronic Engineering of the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien (UAS Technikum Wien) offers 8 (6 part-time, 2 full-time) study programs in German (2 in English). In the winter semester 2016/17 no students of the faculty decided to go for student's exchange abroad. According to a survey conducted with students of the faculty, the majority (64%-96%) would like to go abroad for student's exchange but cannot realize it due to personal or vocational reasons (50%-75%). Additionally, many study programs of the faculty don't offer English teaching material for the technical courses.

The project **"StudyATHome Internationally - International Teaching Setup for Students in Assistive Technologies and Smart Homes"** aims to develop and implement an international teaching setup for students in Assistive Technologies (AT) and Smart Homes (SH) for people which are less mobile due to job, family or disability. This can be part-time students but also full-time students with a job, family or disability. Secondly, the courses of the faculty should be more attractive to incoming students of partner universities. Finally, the accessibility of the courses should be improved.

In course of the project, the following activities will be done:

* **Internationalization at home**
  * International, [virtual student interaction](/virtual-student-interaction/) (formerly referred to as _Virtual Project Teams_) in project-based courses
  * [Sharing of eLearning courses](../e-learning-sharing/) between partner universities
* **AsTeRICS eLearning**
  * [AsTeRICS Webpage](https://www.asterics.eu): Development of a new responsive and accessible web page for AsTeRICS users and developers.
  * [Assistive Technologies eLearning course](../courses/assistive-technologies-basics/): Creation of an eLearning course about the bascis of Assistive Technologies and AsTeRICS.
* **Conversion of learning material to accessible formats**
  * Creation of an Open Educational Resource (OER) about [Rehabilitation Technology (en/de)](https://rehatec.studyathome.technikum-wien.at/). 
* **International Summer School for AT and SH**
* **Competence network with partner universities in the area of AT and SH**
  * Visiting partner sites
  * Knowledge transfer: Conversion of teaching material to accessible formats and standards in user evaluation.
  * Translation and conversion of teaching material
