The research project [StudyATHome
Internationally](https://embsys.technikum-wien.at/projects/studyathome-intl/index.php)
funded by the City of Vienna (grant-nr. 22-07) deals with the
development and implementation of internationalization at home measures
at the UAS Technikum Wien. In the course of this, we provide a web
platform ("StudyATHome Hub") to support the sharing of eLearning courses
between partner universities. The platform lists courses and assists
with the enrollment process. For research purposes, participants will be
asked to fill out a questionaire before and after the participation.

## Data Flow

Your **application data** is processed by the StudyATHome team (studyathome@technikum-wien.at) and will be approved by the home university. It will be forwarded to the International Office of the host university, by e-mail. 

**On request**, you will be asked by the host university to provide the registration data needed for the registration and course enrollment. After successful completion of the course, the International Office of the home university will get a digital copy of your transcript of records.

## Data Protection

The protection of your personal data is of particular concern to the
partner universities and therefore they process your data on the basis
of the legal provisions (GDPR). In this declaration of consent, we (the
team of the organizing university -- in the following *UAS Technikum
Wien*) inform you about the most important aspects of data processing.

**In case of any concern please directly contact the data protection
officer of the university processing your data.**

## Purpose and legal basis

The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is your
consent. Your data will be processed by us to assist you in the
application and grade recognition process and to send out the
questionaire link. Additionally, we use your data to improve the
workflows and to create anonymized statistics about the usage of the
eLearning Sharing program.

The provision of the data is obligatory. Refusal to provide the data or
revocation will result in exclusion from participation (see also
Revocation of consent).

## Use of cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer or mobile
device when you visit a website. Cookies enable the website to remember
your settings (such as username, language, etc.) for a certain period of
time. This means that you do not need to make these settings again when
navigating the website during the same visit. Cookies can also be used
to compile anonymous statistics about the browsing activities of the
website visitor.

The StudyATHome Hub does not use cookies to store information about you.

### Youtube cookies

The StudyATHome hub provides embedded videos of Youtube. Youtube uses
cookies before playing a video. Please read the [privacy information of
google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en).

## Data transmission

The data will not be passed on to third parties. In case of problems
with the application or the grade recognition process, contact data
might be transmitted to partner universities.

## Storage Duration

We will store your data until 3 years after the end of the project
(31.01.2022). The lecturers and partner universities participating are
themselves responsible for the storage and, if applicable, deletion of
their data in accordance with the respective national regulations.

## Revoking your consent

Since we process the data on the basis of your consent, you can revoke
this consent at any time. You can announce this revocation at any time
by informal mail to
[studyathome\@technikum-wien.at](mailto:studyathome@technikum-wien.at).
This revocation does not affect the legality of the processing that has
taken place until then. However, this will result in the cancellation of
the eLearning sharing participation and prevent the issueing of a grade
certificate. Please contact the lecturer at your university in order to
arrange the necessary substitutions for the grade.

## Information on legal rights of appeal

Information on your rights (right of access, deletion, complaint, etc.) can be found at <https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/information-about-your-rights-accordance-general-data-protection-regulation/>.

If you have any questions, you can always contact

You are entitled to the rights of information, correction, deletion,
restriction, data transferability and objection. For this purpose,
please contact
[studyathome\@technikum-wien.at](mailto:studyathome@technikum-wien.at).

If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights have otherwise been violated in any way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. In Austria, the [data protection authority](http://dsb.gv.at/) is
responsible.
