# Assistive Technologies Basics

::: slot information

This course is an introduction to Disability and Assistive Technologies. You will learn types of disabilities and related medical basics. You will get to know the daily challenges of people with disabilities and how to face them with Assistive Technologies.

:::

## Overview

### Contents

- Anatomical and Physiological Background of Disability
- Types of Disabilities
- Types of Assistive Technologies per disability
- Basics of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC)
- Basics in Digital Accessibility
- Basics in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Usability and User Interface Design
- Principles of Design for All
- Use of the [Assistive Technology Integration and Construction Set (AsTeRICS)](https://www.asterics.eu/)
- Use of [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software) and introduction to the Assistive Technologies [FLipMouse](https://www.asterics-foundation.org/projects/the-flipmouse/) and [FABI](https://www.asterics-foundation.org/projects/fabi/)

### Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to

- recognize and classify different kinds of disabilities
- identify the anatomical and physiological reasons for a disability
- list the impairments and restrictions due to a disability
- state accessibility requirements of digital documents and web pages
- evaluate documents for accessibility
- understand the terms "HCI", "Usability" and "UX" and their definitions
- know about the User Centered Design process and related standardisation
- know about basic design principles and methods applied in the User Centered Design process
- Create simple AsTeRICS models
- Identify use cases of FLipMouse and FABI

### Methods

The course is divided in self-study units and practical session at the UAS Technikum Wien on-site. The practical sessions won't be accessible for virtual students but they are not relevant for the grading.

| Type        | Effort \[h\] |

## Assessment

<!-- Describe Assessment procedure verbally -->
There will be 4 assignments individually or in group works and a final exam (multiple choice test).

#### Example Assignment

<!-- Describe an example assignment definition -->
Analyze a given use case (person with disability) in terms of anatomy, physiology, pathology, applicable laws, standards and suitable Assistive Technologies.

#### Final Exam

<!-- The final exam will be ... -->
There will be a multiple choice test reflecting all areas of the course contents.
