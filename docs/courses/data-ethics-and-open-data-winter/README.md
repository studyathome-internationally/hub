# Data Ethics & Open Data (Winter)

::: slot information

Open data is accessible public data that people, companies and organisations can use and process.
The benefit of Open Data is not only the publication itself, but especially its duplication and reuse as new applications and solutions can increase transparency, promote innovation and encourage community engagement.
The extensive use of increasingly more data in general also requires the consideration of complex moral and ethical subjects related to data to support good solutions and responsible handling.
The course will be divided into two subject areas: Lectures on Data Ethics will provide the opportunity to learn about the ethical impacts of data and related topics (privacy, transparency, surveillance etc.).
In lectures on Open Data students will learn about Open Data from a technical viewpoint and work on an Open Data application.
