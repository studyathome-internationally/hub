# Electronic Design

::: slot information
This module teaches students the basic design of analog and digital electronic circuits.
Designing a circuit includes specification, calculation, simulation and documentation of applications.
They will learn to deploy passive and active components, to read and interpret datasheets and to verify the design by simulations.
The focus is on the usage of operational amplifiers.
