# Embedded Systems 2

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
*[ADC]: Analog to Digital Converter
*[GPIO]: General Purpose Input-Output \*[µC]: Mikrocontroller

::: slot information
Internal Course Name: _Electronic Project 2_

This module focuses more on the low-level programming of embedded systems.
Students will improve their knowledge about peripheral components and how to utilize a widely used programming toolchain.
This is achieved by combining their knowledge from the last semester and shifting the focus from system programming to low-level hardware programming.
Important topics like hierarchical programming (drivers and application libraries) as well as commonly used documentation styles (using Doxygen) are introduced.
In the course of this module students are able to program embedded systems without the overhead of using system level programming but with the benefits and challenges of programming at low-level.
:::

## Overview

### Contents

- Setup and Introduction to an Embedded System Platform + Toolchain
- Introduction to hierarchical programming and Doxygen documentation
- Interrupts and ISRs
- Timer Configuration and Usage with Interrupts
- ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) & UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
- PWM (Pulse-Width-Modulation)
- Final Exam

### Outcomes

Participants of this course will learn how to

- Describe and explain the difference between system-level programming and low-level programming
- Describe and explain hierarchical programming
- Describe and explain the differences between application and driver libraries
- Split software projects into several functions, files and folders, according to a hierarchical programming setup
- Use commonly used documentation style (Doxygen)
- Configure and use simple and common µC peripherals
