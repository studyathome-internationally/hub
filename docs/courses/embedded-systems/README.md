# Embedded Systems

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
*[ADC]: Analog to Digital Converter
*[GPIO]: General Purpose Input-Output \*[µC]: Mikrocontroller

::: slot information
This module teaches students the basics of programming common peripherals of embedded systems.
Hence, this module focuses on understanding the general functionality of common microcontroller applications.

This is achieved by starting on a higher programming level (system programing level) and gradually introducing them to the hardware programming level.

In the course of this module students are able to train embedded programming skills within a beginner friendly development toolchain.
:::

## Overview

### Contents

- Setup and Introduction to an Embedded System Platform & Toolchain
- Standard I/O User Application
- Typical µC-Phrases
- GPIO Configuration and Usage
- Timer Configuration and Usage
- ADC Configuration and Usage

### Outcomes

Participants of this course will learn how to

- describe and explain the difference between an embedded system and a normal PC
- describe and explain different commonly used µC peripherals
- split software projects into several functions, files and folders, according to the complexity of the project
- use code comments in a way, which helps them and others to understand their code
- configure and use simple and common µC peripherals

### Methods & Schedule

This course is organized as an **asynchronous** distance learning course with a **webinar** at the beginning of the course. You can study the assignments in a flexible way according to your schedule. Additonally, you will get lecturer support, on demand.
