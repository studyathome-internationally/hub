* Information architecture
* Interaction patterns
* Content organization in interactive systems
  * Organizational schemes
  * Structure organization
  * Patterns for organizing and displaying data
* Navigation
  * Problems and principles for good navigation
  * Patterns in interactive systems
* Screen organization
    * Basic concepts
    * Techniques for grouping and arranging elements
     * Patterns for organizing screens
* Forms and data entry
  * Principles for designing forms
  * Types of input data and controls
  * Patterns for designing forms (relationships between elements, values of elements ...)
* Actions and commands
  * Representation and rendering of actions
  * Commands patterns
* Interaction with data lists
* Interaction in social media
* Interaction in mobile devices, features of the interaction in mobile devices, interaction patterns.

### Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to

- demonstrate knowledge about the basic principles of effective and efficient user interaction
- apply the basic principles when designing a user interface
- develop an interactive application following the learned principles

### Methods

Lectures as online presentations (video conferences), lab exercises (assignments), teamwork, case studies, invited guest lecturers, self-study.  

The lectures will be held weekly with several groups (dates) offered.

| Type                       | Effort \[h\] |
| :------------------------- | :----------- |
| Lectures                   | 30           |
| Lab Exercises (Assignments)                 | 40           |
| Colloquiums                | 50           |
| Self-Study              | 30           |

## Assessment

The assessment consists of several elements like lab exercises (assignments), quizzes (related to the online lectures) and 2 colloquiums. If a student does not collect enough points he/she will have to do an additional practical exam.

Students of StudyATHome Internationally are advised to do both colloquiums for being able to finish the course within the semester (end of January).

### Methods

| Type                  | Points |
| :-------------------- | :------------- |
| Lab exercises (Assignments)        | 5 points      |
| Quizzes |15 points      |
| Colloquium 1            | 40 points      |
| Colloquium 2            | 40 points      |

### Minimum Requirements

The course is passed if at least 50% of the points are collected from all assessments, no matter how many points are collected from each of them.

### Lab exercises (Assignments)

The students will have to do graded lab exercises (assignments) that have to be solved at home and uploaded until a given deadline.

We count all timely uploaded solutions. To obtain points, each student has to take an exam that is related to the uploaded solution.
The exam can only be taken once during the January examination period.

The total number of points is calculated by scaling the number of points earned on the exam with the number of timely uploaded solutions. The maximum number of points is won only if all lab exercises are uploaded on time. If the student does not take the lab exam, he will obtain 0 points of the same.

### Colloquiums (1 & 2)

Colloquiums consist of a practical problem. You need to solve the problem by programming (100% of points) or by drawing the screen layout (not all points).

No minimum points for passing the colloquium are defined (You can participate in the second colloquium even if you obtain zero points on the first colloquium).

### Quizzes

The quizzes are short tests related to details of the lectures.

Quizzes are taken on Moodle along with colloquiums (two separate quizzes with the first and second colloquium) or the practical exam (single quiz together with the practical exam in examination period).

### Practical Exam

The practical exam is mandatory only, **if** the student failed to collect **at least 50%** of the points of the colloquia.

You need to solve the problem by programming (100% of points) or by drawing the screen layout (not all points).

### Criteria

| Grade | Grade (letter) | Scale            |
| :---- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| 5     | F              | up to 50 points  |
| 6     | E              | 51 to 60 points  |
| 7     | D              | 61 to 70 points  |
| 8     | C              | 71 to 80 points  |
