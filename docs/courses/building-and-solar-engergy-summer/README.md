# Building and Solar Energy (Summer)

::: slot information
Design of a solar system for a housing complex including technical parameter and the contribution to the local electricity system while considering local heating and mobility needs. Furthermore, the economic and ecologic impacts are calculated.

**Please Note: The course is limited to two students and requires physical attendance in Vienna for 5 days in February.**
:::

## Overview

### Contents

- Energy characterization and energy planning of solar building
- Designing a building-integrated photovoltaic installation by software tools

- Solar energy system
- Energy planning of buildings

### Equipment

- Windows OS for free Photovoltaic Emulation Software

## Attendance

The course starts with a **compulsary 5-day attendance block** in Februar (Calendar Week xx) including an excursion to a city development site.
Afterwards, the course can be continued virtually.

Please ask your outgoing coordinator (International Office) for funding possibilities or write to [studyathome@technikum-wien.at](mailto:studyathome@technikum-wien.at).

## Comments

The course participants will be both traditional incoming students and students of the StudyATHome program.

The course is setup according to project-based learning and is done in cooperation with a real city development project from the city of Vienna (MA20), the city of Korneuburg and the Master program Renewable Energy.
