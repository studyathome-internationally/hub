# IoT-Standards-Protocols

::: slot information
The _Internet of Things_ (IoT) encompasses a broad range and scale of devices and applications.
This module examines the protocols and standards used to interconnect the various devices and applications in the Internet of Things.

The [course material](https://tutors-svelte.netlify.app/#/course/iot-protocols-2021.netlify.app) can be found online, the major topics are:

- The Internet of Things protocol stack
- Device level communication bus protocols
  - Event-driven bus protocols
  - serial communication
- Device interfacing and embedded application APIs
- Wireless communication for the IoT
  - Introduction to Wireless Networks
  - wireless protocols for low power devices
  - short-range wireless technologies
- Messaging protocols for the Internet of Things
  - Request-Response
  - Publish-Subscribe

### Testimonials

::: testimonial SS 2021 Maria Schildbeck

The lectures started on Monday, 25 January 2021 and ended Friday, 30 April 2021. We had a 1-hour theory lecture and a 3-hour practical lab exercise per week. For the labs we got a written step-by-step instruction in advance, and the lecturer was present for additional hints and to answer questions. We used the CISCO Packet Tracer, Raspberry Pi, Python/JavaScript.

The project started in February by first submitting a short proposal (short description what it will be and which technologies in use (protocols, devices, programming language, …)). On May 9th was the submission of the finished project (Git Repository with all code and resources, 10 min video showing the work), a few days later a zoom meeting to present/discuss the work.

The grading was 100% project.

### Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, a student will be able to:

1. Distinguish between the communication and data requirements for the general Web protocol stack and Internet of Things protocol stack.
2. Create an appropriate physical layer specification for wireless networked devices based on application requirements.
3. Use low power, low overhead, wireless communication protocols to interconnect resource constrained sensors, actuators and other devices.
4. Apply lightweight messaging solutions that mediate between device level sensors and higher layer applications and services.
5. Use IoT gateway solutions to connect devices and higher level service layer networks.
6. Design domain-specific IoT solutions (e.g. health care) using suitable IoT protocols and standards.

### Methods

- Combination of lectures and computer/network laboratory work.
- Labs will provide practical knowledge of the design and implementation of IoT-specific communication protocol solutions.
- Lectures will provide theoretical knowledge of IoT protocols and standards.
- As part of the lectures, case studies will be used to illustrate real-world IoT solutions using the standards and protocols covered in lectures(e.g. smart spaces).
