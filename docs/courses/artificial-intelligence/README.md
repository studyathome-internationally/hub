# Artificial Intelligence

::: slot information
The course will introduce the students to the basic objectives of artificial intelligence, key methods and examples of most common practical applications. The students will get an overview of current intelligent systems approaches, will try to use selected methods and test their important features.
The topics cover state-space search methods, knowledge and its representation, automatic logical reasoning with uncertainty, machine learning, distributed artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation. In the practical part, applications to both synthetic and real-world problems will be focused.

## Overview

### Contents

- Lecture 1: Goals, problems, and tools of artificial intelligence
- Lecture 2: Problem representation and solution using state-space search
- Lecture 3: Choice of informed search algorithm and its heuristic function
- Lecture 4: Scheduling problems and their solutions
- Lecture 5: Types and representation of knowledge used for problem-solving in AI
- Lecture 6: Deduction and induction
- Lecture 7: Decision support knowledge systems
- Lecture 8: Uncertainty in knowledge systems
- Lecture 9: Natural language processing, knowledge acquisition from text
- Lecture 10: Human-machine interface and dialog systems design
- Lecture 11: Introduction to reinforcement learning
- Lecture 12: Methods of reinforcement learning
- Lecture 13: Nature-inspired methods for suboptimal solution of optimization problems
- Lecture 14: Other methods and their applications

Practical seminars will follow the topics of the lectures.

### Outcomes

Upon the completion of the course the student

- is able to describe objective and practical examples of artificial intelligence
- is able to select from several approaches and test the underlying features
- is able to use algorithms for state-space search and logical reasoning
- is able to indicate basic concepts of machine learning
- is able to use natural language processing

### Methods

- Online Lectures: 2 hours per week (28h / semester).
- Seminars / Computer lab: 2 hours per week (28h / semester).

Additionally, the student is expected to do independent study at home and to deliver the homeworks (= assignments).

| Type        | Effort \[h\] |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| Lecture     | 28           |
| Practical   | 28           |
| Independent | 40           |

## Assessment

Students will get three smaller single-choice tests (10 points each) and two homeworks (15 points each). The final exam will be a multiplce choice test (40 points).
The final score is the sum of all tests and homeworks.

### Example Assignment

In the topic of search algorithms a typical example can be the [8 puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). The student has to use breadth-first search / depth-first search / branch-and-bound algorithm or the A-star algorithm and find at least one solution. In case the algorithm uses a heuristic, the student has to propose the heuristic and justify the proposal.

### Minimum Requirements

At least 50% from smaller tests, 50% from home-works, 50% from final exam.

### Methods

| Type          | Points |
| :------------ | :----- |
| Smaller Tests | 30     |
| Homework      | 30     |
| Final exam    | 40     |

### Criteria

| Grade | Grade (letter) | Scale            |
| :---- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| 5     | F (not passed) | up to 49 points  |
| 6     | E              | 50 to 59 points  |
| 7     | D              | 60 to 69 points  |
| 8     | C              | 70 to 79 points  |
| 9     | B              | 80 to 89 points  |
| 10    | A              | 90 to 100 points |

## Requirements

### Skills

It is expected that the students will have basic skills in using the algorithms, get orientation in available AI tools and will be able to apply them to basic tasks.

Additionally you should have basic knowledge in

- Mathematics (functions, derivative, basic vector calculus, probability, basic statistics)
- Programming (in one of Matlab, Python, Java, ...)

Students with no programming experience are advised not to take the course.

### Equipment

Any programming language which suits the student.
